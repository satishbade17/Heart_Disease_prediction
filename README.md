❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Built an end-to-end ML pipeline—from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and deployment.

📌 Models implemented and evaluated:
• Logistic Regression
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
• Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
• Decision Tree
• Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)
